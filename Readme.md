Week 4 Python Assignment
Overview

This repository contains two Python exercises focused on file handling and error handling:

File Read & Write Challenge

Error Handling Lab

These exercises help practice reading, writing, processing files, and managing exceptions in Python.

1. File Read & Write Challenge 

Objective:
Create a program that reads a file, processes its content, and writes the result to a new file.

Key Features:

Reads input.txt.

Converts all text to uppercase.

Counts the number of words.

Writes the processed content and word count to output.txt.

Prints a success message when done.

Files:

input.txt → Sample input file with at least 5 lines of text.

Openfile.py → Python script implementing the challenge.

2. Error Handling Lab 

Objective:
Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

Key Features:

Prompts the user to enter a filename.

Reads and prints the file content.

Handles FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and other exceptions gracefully.

Prevents program crashes due to missing or unreadable files.

Files:

error_handling.py → Python script implementing the error handling lab.

How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Place the scripts and input.txt in the same folder.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder.

Run the scripts:

python Openfile.py
python error_handling.py

Outcomes

By completing these exercises, i was able to:

Read and write files in Python.

Process text data programmatically.

Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

Build robust Python programs that interact with files safely.
