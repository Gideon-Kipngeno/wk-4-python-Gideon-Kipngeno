**Week 4 Python Assignment**
## Overview
This repository contains my **Week 4 Python Assignment**, which focuses on file handling and exception handling. The assignment is divided into two main parts:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**  
   - Reads a file (`input.txt`)  
   - Processes the content by converting it to uppercase  
   - Counts the number of words  
   - Writes the modified content and word count to a new file (`output.txt`)  

2. **Error Handling Lab**

Objective:
Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

Key Features:

   - Asks the user for a filename  
   - Reads and prints the file’s content  
   - Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist or cannot be read  

Files:

error_handling.py → Python script implementing the error handling lab.

## Skills Practiced
- Reading from and writing to files in Python
- Text processing and word counting
- Exception handling using `try-except`
- Writing clean, maintainable Python code

## Files
- `input.txt` – Sample input file with text content  
- `Openfile.py` – Python script implementing the file read/write challenge  
- `error_handling.py` – Python script implementing the file read/write challenge and error handling
- `output.txt` – Output file generated by the script  

## How to Run
1. Make sure `input.txt` exists in the same folder as `Openfile.py`.  
2. Run the script in your Python environment:

```bash
python Openfile.py
python error_handling.py
